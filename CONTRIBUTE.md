This repo is meant as a collective resource, where **any contributions** from a single tool or article to suggestions on a structure overhaul **are welcome**. You may send suggestions via eMail or Twitter (@dlaehnemann), but the easiest way to contribute (including proper attribution) is by:

1. [Forking this repository.](https://github.com/dlaehnemann/sustainable_software_development_tools#fork-destination-box)
2. Adding the suggestion in the `README.md`
3. Submitting a pull request.

For contributions, please cosider these evolving guidelines. We want to:

* avoid duplications (quickly search the README.md before starting on your contribution)
* keep descriptions short and clear, with correct spelling (make it easy for the readers)
* wherever good overviews already exist, please include links to them here instead of their contents
* make one pull request per suggestion (this keeps the merge history as useful as possible)
* for proprietary/commercial tools, check if there's a good open alternative (sustainable software development and `open`ness imply each other, I'd think, but commercial offerings might nevertheless be the best current solution out there)

Looking forward to your contributions!
